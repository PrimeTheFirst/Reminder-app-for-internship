# A simple reminder app

This is a very simple reminder app I made based on the given requirements for an internship, to see whether I'm good enough or not. 

Create a simple reminder application. A person has to be reminded on the below activities on daily basis in a span of 24 hour:  

[Day of the week]  
Wake up   
• Go to gym   
• Breakfast  
• Meetings  
• Lunch  
• Quick nap   
• Go to library  
• Dinner  
• Go to sleep  

The UI should be based on only drop-down lists for selecting the day of the week, choose the time and the choice of activities as given below. Once the time is up the app should play a sound / chime.

[Drop-down for day] : [Drop-down for choosing the time (clock widget is preferred)] : [Drop-down containing the list of above activities]

Made for windows. 

No library was used to schedule alarms. Logic is original, and also probably not the most efficient way to do it. Its the first thing I though of and it works.
